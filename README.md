# Gaza: Voices of Resilience

## 🕊️ About This Project

This interactive documentary bears witness to the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. It is a digital memorial, a call to consciousness, and a platform for voices that the world must not ignore.

## 📖 What's Happening in Gaza

Gaza, home to over 2 million people, has endured a severe humanitarian crisis. The blockade, ongoing conflict, and destruction have created one of the most pressing humanitarian emergencies of our time.

**The Human Cost:**
- Over **50,000 lives lost**, with 75% being children and women
- **2 million people displaced** from their homes
- **70% of infrastructure destroyed**, including hospitals, schools, and homes
- Families torn apart, generations traumatized
- A population denied basic human rights: freedom of movement, access to clean water, medical care, and education

This is not just about numbers—each statistic represents a human being with dreams, families, and aspirations. Mothers, fathers, children, teachers, doctors, artists. People who deserve to live in peace and dignity.

## ✊ Why This Matters

"They tried to bury us. They didn't know we were seeds." - Palestinian Proverb

This website exists because:
- **Silence is complicity.** The world must know what is happening.
- **Every life matters.** Behind every number is a human story that deserves to be told.
- **History is watching.** How we respond to this crisis will define our collective humanity.
- **Hope persists.** Even in the darkest times, the resilience of the Palestinian people shines through.

We invite you to witness, to learn, to feel, and to act. This is not just Gaza's story—it is a test of our shared humanity.

## 🎨 Design System

The project uses a semantic design system defined in:
- `src/index.css` - CSS custom properties for colors, gradients, shadows
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind theme extensions

All components use semantic tokens (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `muted`) for consistent theming.
